        <h1>betty's coursework</h1>
        <p>As an engineering student in college and a program manager at a tech company, I've picked up some formal and informal knowledge about programming. However, in order to make the pivot into software programming a little easier, I chose to complete the career path, "Front-end Engineer," offered by Codecademy.</p>
        <p>For further learning, I've completed the majority of their "Back-end Engineer" and "Web Developer" career and skill paths, as well as their courses for Node.js, Express, React, Redux, and JavaScript, which I've chosen to supplement with online coding practice like Leetcode, and books like Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and Eloquent Javascript by Marjin Haverbeke.
        <p>You can see some of the courses I've taken on Codecademy here: https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/bxzr1</p>
        <p>To exercise and build on the knowledge I gained there, I'm working on some personal projects that you can see over on my Personal tab.</p>
        <p>To check out some of the sites and apps I've created based on what I've learned from the course(s), explore below!</p>
