change h1 to follow (@media only screen and (min-width: 1400px)) media rules all the time (the spaced out letters on two lines look weird)

can i grow the blurb (a baking and cooking club...) text as the screen gets smaller?

the second media type (@media only screen and (max-width: 600px)) - as the screen continues to get smaller, the body text also becomes smaller and unreadable
